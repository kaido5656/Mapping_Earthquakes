# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Purpose
  The purpose of this exercise was to utilize API's and javascript to visualize different types of earthquake data. This project was largely done with mapbox/leaflet and with geojson. Using our previous knowledge with d3 and working with jsons, I was able to visualize an interactive map with various layers of data over the map to allow for a clean and consise visualization of earthquakes.
